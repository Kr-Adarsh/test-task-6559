# test-task-6559

## Summary

This project delivers a minimal, static web page designed to meet a specific requirement: displaying the text "Hello World" within a designated HTML element. It serves as a foundational demonstration of basic web development structure using pure HTML.

## Features

*   **Static Content Display:** Renders a fixed "Hello World" message.
*   **Semantic Structure:** Utilizes a `div` element with the required ID (`greeting`) for content containment.
*   **Custom Title:** Sets the page title to "Test Application".

## Setup

This application is a static HTML page and requires no complex build tools or server environment to run.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd test-task-6559
    ```
2.  **Locate the File:** The main application file is typically named `index.html`.
3.  **Open in Browser:** Double-click the `index.html` file, or open it using your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

## Usage

The application is entirely static and requires no user interaction.

1.  **Launch the Page:** Follow the setup instructions to open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  **Verification:** The browser tab title should display "Test Application".
3.  **Content Check:** The main body of the page will display the text "Hello World".

## Implementation Details

The application is built using the following minimal technical stack:

*   **HTML5:** Used for structuring the content and defining the required elements.
*   **CSS/JavaScript:** Not utilized, as the requirements are met purely through static HTML.

The core functionality is achieved by defining the required structure within the `<body>` of the HTML document, ensuring the text content is placed inside a `div` element with the ID `greeting`.

## Code Structure

The project structure is extremely simple, consisting primarily of a single file:

*   `index.html`: Contains the entire structure, including the `<title>` tag and the `div id="greeting"` element housing the "Hello World" text.

The logic is straightforward: the browser parses the HTML and renders the predefined content directly.
