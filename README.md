# test-task-6559

## Summary

This project involves the development and enhancement of a static web page, focusing on both content accuracy and modern aesthetic design. The application was updated to meet specific content requirements, including a revised greeting message and the addition of essential contact information. Furthermore, the entire webpage was styled using a modern theme incorporating light, non-intrusive animation effects to improve visual appeal and user experience.

## Features

*   **Updated Content Display:** Prominently displays the required greeting message, "Hello World v2".
*   **Semantic Structure:** Utilizes an element with the ID `greeting` for the main content display.
*   **Contact Information:** Includes a dedicated, professional footer section containing relevant contact details.
*   **Modern Aesthetics:** Features a clean, modern design theme with an optimized color palette.
*   **Light Animations:** Implements subtle CSS transitions and animations for enhanced visual engagement.

## Setup

This application is a static web page and does not require a server environment or complex dependencies to run.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd test-task-6559
    ```
3.  **Run the Application:**
    Open the `index.html` file directly in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

The application is designed for immediate viewing and inspection of the implemented features.

1.  **Load the Page:** Open `index.html` in your browser.
2.  **Verify Greeting:** Confirm that the main content area displays the text "Hello World v2".
3.  **Observe Aesthetics:** Note the modern layout, color scheme, and the subtle animation effects (e.g., hover states, background transitions).
4.  **Check Footer:** Scroll to the bottom of the page to locate and verify the presence of the footer containing contact information.

## Implementation Details

### Technical Stack

*   **HTML5:** Used for the foundational structure and semantic organization of the content.
*   **CSS3:** Utilized extensively for styling, responsive design, modern layout implementation, and defining all light animation effects.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript:** Used minimally, primarily for potential future interactivity or minor DOM manipulation, though the core requirements are met via HTML/CSS.

### How it Works

The application functions as a single-page interface. The aesthetic enhancements and animations are achieved purely through CSS, leveraging properties like `transition`, `transform`, and modern layout techniques (Flexbox/Grid) to ensure a clean, responsive, and visually appealing experience without relying on heavy external libraries.

## Code Structure

The project maintains a straightforward and logical file structure suitable for a static web application:

*   `index.html`: The main entry point. Contains the DOCTYPE, metadata, the `#greeting` element, and the footer structure.
*   `css/style.css`: Contains all custom CSS rules, including definitions for the modern color scheme, layout rules, and the keyframes/transitions for the light animation effects.
*   `js/main.js`: Reserved for any potential client-side scripting, maintaining a clean separation of concerns.
